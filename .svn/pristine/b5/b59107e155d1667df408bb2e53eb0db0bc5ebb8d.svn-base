/*
 * Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an applet uses
 * to communicate with its applet context.
 * <p>
 * The applet framework involves two entities:
 * the applet and the applet context. An applet is an embeddable window (see the 
 * {@link java.awt.Panel} class) with a few extra methods that the applet context 
 * can use to initialize, start, and stop the applet.
 * @since 1.0
